I am a visualization data scientist who has developed dashboards for the Wounded Warrior Project, the Center for Disease Control, and worked on data science projects for many more stakeholders. I am a PhD candidate in Policy Analysis at the Pardee RAND Graduate School. I believe research communication can be used to motivate and give people tools to make better policy decisions. I want to improve policy-makers' abilities to make evidence-based decisions about climate change.
